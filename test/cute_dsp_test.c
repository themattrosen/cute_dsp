    cute_dsp_test.c - v1.0

    To compile:

        gcc -o cute_dsp_test cute_dsp_test.c cute_dsp_audio_data.c

    To run:

        ./cute_dsp_test <input-file>.wav <options>

        <input-file> is a simple 16 bit, 44.1kHZ .wav file to process
        <options> can be any of the following:
            -l = process the input with a lowpass filter, output-l.wav
            -h = process the input with a highpass filter, output-h.wav

    Summary:
        Meant as a test framework for cute_dsp.h to output .wav files that will 
        demonstrate the features in the project.

    Revision history:
        1.0     (05/25/2019) initial release:
